# More functions, more nested loops

**In this repository, more nested loops and function tasks are done.**

| Task | Description |
|--|--|
| 0-isupper.c |Write a function that checks for uppercase character.  |
| 1-isdigit.c| Write a function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`). |
| 2-mul.c | Write a function that multiplies two integers. |
| 3-print_numbers.c | Write a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line. |
| File: `4-print_most_numbers.c` | Write a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line. |
| 5-more_numbers.c | Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`, followed by a new line. |
| 6-print_line.c | Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal. |
| 7-print_diagonal.c | Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal. |
| 8-print_square.c |Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.  |
| 9-fizz_buzz.c | Write a program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`. |
| 10-print_triangle.c | Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line. |
| 100-prime_factor.c | Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143`, followed by a new line. |
| 101-print_number.c | Write a function that prints an integer. |
