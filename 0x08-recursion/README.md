| 3-factorial.c |Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.  |
| 4-pow_recursion.c | Write a function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`. |
| 5-sqrt_recursion.c | Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number. |
| 6-is_prime_number.c | Write a function that returns `1` if the input integer is a [prime number](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/uMon4hPzNyQ_WSgpnTlShw "prime number"), otherwise return `0`. |
| 7-is_palindrome.c | Write a function that returns  `1`  if a string is a palindrome and  `0`  if not. |
