# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

**In this project, conditions, variables, and cycles are studied in C language.
Variables such as int, unsigned and signed, char, and float.
Conditions as in if, if else, and else.
Cycles as in for and while.**

| Task | Description |
|--|--|
|0-positive_or_negative.c | This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative. |
| 1-last_digit.c | This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`. |
| 2-print_alphabet.c |
| 3-print_alphabets.c | Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. |
| 4-print_alphabt.c| Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. |
| 5-print_numbers.c | Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line. |
| 6-print_numberz.c | Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line. |
| 7-print_tebahpla.c | Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. |
|8-print_base16.c | Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. |
| 9-print_comb.c | Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.| 
|10-print_comb2.c  | Write a program that prints the numbers from `00` to `99`.|
