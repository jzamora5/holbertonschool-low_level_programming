# Functions and Nested Loops

**In this repository, different tasks are done to study nested loops, functions
definitions and declarations, and headers.**


| Task | Description |
|--|--|
| 0-holberton.c | Write a program that prints `Holberton`, followed by a new line. |
| 1-alphabet.c | Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. |
| 2-print_alphabet_x10.c | Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. |
| 3-islower.c | Write a function that checks for lowercase character. |
| 4-isalpha.c |  Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.|
| 5-sign.c | Write a function that prints the sign of a number. |
| 6-abs.c | Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer. |
| 7-print_last_digit.c |  Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.|
|8-24_hours.c | Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59. |
| 9-times_table.c | Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0. |
| 10-add.c |Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.  |
| 11-print_to_98.c | Write a function that prints all natural numbers from `n` to `98`, followed by a new line. |
| 100-times_table.c | Write a function that prints the `n` times table, starting with 0. |
| 101-natural.c| If we list all the natural numbers below `10` that are multiples of `3` or `5`, we get `3`, `5`, `6` and `9`. The sum of these multiples is `23`. Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of `3` or `5` below `1024` (excluded), followed by a new line. |
| 102-fibonacci.c | Write a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`, followed by a new line. |
| 103-fibonacci.c | Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with `1` and `2`, the first 10 terms will be: `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89`. By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, write a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line. |
| 104-fibonacci.c | Write a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`, followed by a new line. |
