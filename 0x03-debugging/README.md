### [0. Multiple mains](./0-main.c)
* In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:


### [1. Like, comment, subscribe](./1-main.c)
* Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.


### [2. 0 > 972?](./2-largest_number.c)
* This program prints the largest of three integers.


### [3. Leap year](./3-print_remaining_days.c)
* This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
